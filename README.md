## HRR in goats

- AdaptMap data (background): select commercial and marginal (likely not subjected to intense artificial selection, but also free of major demographic events like bottlenecks) 
- ideally with sample size > 50
- identify common HRR (across selected commercial populations and marginal naive populations)
- likely regions that are conserved irrespective of selection pressure  --> regions conserved in *C. hircus* and that may have a biological function
- fix the parameters for the identification of HRR (may be tweaked) and explore the effect of imputing missing SNP genotypes
- sex chromosomes?
